which is a virtual emulator where you can install and run this app. Sometimes AVD doesn't work properly(As we've faced), you can connect your phone to your pc and run on it.  
To install and run this project on your phone you need to turn on your USB Debugging option of your phone, which you will find in Settings>Developer options(May vary in different device). And also running android project on your phone is a lot less heavier than running on AVD as android studio itself is a very heavy software.
